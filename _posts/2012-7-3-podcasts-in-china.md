One good news for podcast users like me is that Apple released a dedicated [Podcasts app](http://itunes.apple.com/hk/app/podcasts/id525463029?mt=8) to help iOS users manage their podcast subscriptions. This strategy is very similar to the release of iBooks, a successful spin-off from the main iTunes Store functionality to start a new headwind. However, both digital books and podcasts have gone mainstream enough in China due to various reasons. Will podcasting revive through this new push from Apple?

[YouDeLiao Podcast](http://ydlbk.com), a leading tech podcast, immediately followed up with a new episode discussing the history and trends of podcasting in China. The podcast can be [subscribed on iTunes](http://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id493254305), streammed online or found on a popular voicechat platform [YY](http://yy.com). The podcast is regularly updated on weekly basis, 112 episodes to date, all for free, but also takes [donation](http://www.ydlbk.com/donation/). [Youzang](http://weibo.com/270760222), the creator of this show also a hardcore gadget user, owns a gadget shop in Beijing selling smartphones and accessories and appears very popular in the gadget community and related social networks. "There are more and more podcasts in China this year." Youzang commented in the recent episode show.

Youzang also mentioned [Antiwave](https://www.google.com/search?sugexp=chrome,mod=3&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=%E5%8F%8D%E6%B3%A2+antiwave), an indie talk show created by [Flypig](http://flypig.org) and Buchimifan. Mixed with geek-styled humor and critical views of cultural and social trends, the show was popular enough to receive [international awards from Deutsche Welle](http://baike.baidu.com/view/350380.htm) and sponsorship from Cisco.

YouDeLiao and Antiwave are merely the good examples of the indie podcasts. Commercial productions from traditional media also take spots on the Chinese iTunes Podcast Directory. On the Top Charts, Sina, VOA and BBC have taken enough spots to impress the mainstream audience.

Podcasts are a typical Apple invention, similar to many things but also different enough to be accepted as a new media type. Since [Odeo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odeo) gave its way to Twitter, Apple almost controlled the distribution channel of this periodical form of audio publication. Podcast to radio is very much like magazine to newspaper: one gets depth and quality and the other gets timeliness and coverage. As people in US are shifting from cheap public radio to personalized and digitalized audio services (read: SoundCloud, Spotify and Rdio), they may not be aware that they have blurred the line between the on-demand and offline-use podcast model and the DJ-controlled and over-the-air radio model. Yes, this is fine. But when you consider data cost to stream digital radio in China, this requires a second thought. Many people would still care to use WIFI at home to download the shows at full length to play them while driving to work. The rising young professionals in China seem to be the perfect target users for podcasts: daily commuters and smartphone users, educated enough to be worried about getting relevant "updates" from the opinion leaders they choose to follow, tired from old-fashioned public radio (and even the love songs they have been listening to since high school). Looking at the earphones plugged into the young brains, what are they supposed to listen to?

Building on top of this emerging consumer pattern needs some good work in place. Music streaming services are crowded enough to host [Baidu](http://ting.baidu.com), [Tencent](http://music.qq.com) and [Douban](http://douban.fm) in the league. Podcasting sounds like a new continent to explore. The SoundCloud of China? There must be someone to be in that place, just a matter of time.
