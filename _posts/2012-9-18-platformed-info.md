We launched a new platform called MIX a little more than a month ago. It was a long-waited product launch as the team has been excited about it since end of last year. Different from any exiting mobile ad platforms, it adds some "community" elements by having a "marketplace" for app developers (in this case, mobile game developers) to trade ad inventory.

This brings up a new type of challenge: building a two-sided market through attracting both buyers and sellers to the platform. It seems similar with any classic ad network model, but MIX is even more sophisticated as we designed it to be a peer-to-peer network, instead of an algorithm-driven automated trading floor.

A new blog called [Platformed](http://platformed.info), which launched almost around the same time as MIX, elaborated about the nature of Internet business (or how it is different than traditional businesses):

> 1. Internet businesses are usually multi-sided connecting one or more groups of producers with one or more groups of consumers and themselves acting as intermediaries. The network through which business flows is open and democratic. It’s called the internet.
> 2. The inputs to business are talent and data. Talent is different from labor, it’s not assembly-line… and it’s rare. Businesses scale by scaling these 2 parameters.
> 3. Businesses don’t need optimization when they scale well. Optimization is largely automated. Innovation is what businesses invest in.
> 4. Internet businesses have real-rime personalized feedback loops, almost freakishly accurate at times.
> 5. Innovations is rapid, it’s agile and it’s lean.
> 6. Internet businesses differentiate themselves by enabling information discovery and efficiency. Google’s adwords bidding model is a classic example where pricing is optimized by the market, not by the platform.

I would suggest you subscribe to this blog or, at least, check it out from time to time. The wisdom behind the writing is profound and thorough. Different than most of the growth hacks / product marketing bloggers, this author tries to identify the patterns through abstracting and modeling of two-sided or multi-sided markets, without using too many popular examples of seemingly clever marketing tactics.
