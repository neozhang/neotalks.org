It is the era of "app boom". [46MM app downloads](http://venturebeat.com/2012/05/30/app-store-downloads/) are happening every day on iTunes App Store, while thousands of new apps rushing to the platform in attempt to be the next Instagram or Foursquare. Natively built and centrally distributed, mobile apps use more technical costs and marketing budgets to promote than websites. Moreover, the skillset of designing creative and intuitive user inferfaces for touchscreens has not been acquired by many. From the day one, we are never surprised to see China copycats of globally successful apps - from names, icons, UI designs and market strategies. The recent wave of Path clones pushes this trend to its extreme form - we start to get surprised by the pixel-perfection of the new copycats and their perspectives of competing in the crowded mobile social space in China.

## A Quick Look

[**Taohuayuan Si Weibo**](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tao-hua-yuan-si-wei-bo/id517926523?mt=8) - this recently released mobile social app basically takes 100% of Path UI. And the team claimed that the "copy UI" decision was made after "profound and rational thinking". In an interview, the founder explained that the app will differentiate itself on user operations, and will add localized features like offline message history, guestbook and user data migration. The team has 10+ employees and raised funding of USD 1 million.

[**Meike**](http://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/mei-ke/id515190686?mt=8) - published by Kaixin001, a popular Facebook-like social network in China, Meike also copied almost everything from Path. In the latest release, the app started to add a "voice message" feature which was not included in Path. Interestingly enough, Kaixin001 built its first success by copying Facebook and FarmVille a few years, but the service has lost a significant share of traffic recently, leading to its continuous copying of Pinterest ([Jipin](http://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/kai-xin-ji-pin/id505948472?mt=8) and Path (Meike).

[**Shiguangliu**](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shi-guang-liu/id484829029?mt=8) - as a start-up aiming to be the mobile social network of choice, Shiguangliu was one of the first China apps which adopted the Path-like design. Honestly, it added its own flavor, but in this situation these tweaks may not be perceived as silver bullets.

Some other apps include [**Diandi**](http://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/dian-di-quan-xin-yi-dong-si/id504173860) and [**Jiaoyin**](http://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/jiao-yin/id492236906?mt=8). These apps use 90% of Path design and only changed the color set or other detail tweaks. Some product managers think that the ability to copy fast and localize smartly is the key success factor.

## The China Path or the Copy Path?

It is interesting to see so many similar apps hitting the App Store at roughly the same time. The execution can be compared so easily by trying them all and comparing features and details. But for normal users, does it matter if this app deals with colors more carefully? No. They will end up using whatever they see in the market first, or whatever most of their friends are using. Hitting the market first and reaching the critical mass first mean a lot more than UI innovations for such a market.

When [Paul](http://twitter.com/tapbot_paul), the maker of [Tweetbot](http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/), tweeted "awfully familiar" on Moke, the Weibo app with 90% of UI cloned from Tweetbot, we can tell how the US community thinks about the China copycats. Some of them may not care that much - China is certainly not even on the wildest roadmap of Path and Tweetbot - but others will be concerning how this missing part of the world could be the last unconquerable wonderland at the end of the day.

In [Peter Thiel's CS183 Class 13 Notes](http://blakemasters.tumblr.com/post/23435743973/peter-thiels-cs183-startup-class-13-notes-essay), he argued how a determinate pessimistic China could drive the nation to endless, fast and high quality copying. His mega-macro-theory goes:

> The China view is that there is indeed a calculus as to what to do to improve things for society. Things are determinate ... China will get old before it gets rich. It is forever destined to be a poor version of the U.S. It can and will copy things.

However, things could evolve in another path on the micro level: the first one hitting the mass market could quickly learn from its user data, adapt to the local user voices, and finally become heavily market-oriented and operation-driven product with deep roots in local users. Look at what Path has done with its Chinese version: poor translation quality is poor and lack of integration with local social networks. Flipboard, Instagram and Evernote have done significant better jobs at these, but with limited operational footprint in China, they will find it difficult in expanding its initial success with increasing local competition. Not to mention the local-dependent business models for such products - advertising and virtual currency - are any of these app companies ready to reap the fruits if they had the scale? If not, should the China advertisers and users wait till when it's ready?

While some argue that it is the language, culture and regulations that create the entry barriers, the China path of building and growing an Internet product is more about speed of execution, local partnerships and user community. These topics are less discussed in the US start-up communities, especially compared to topics around UX, designs or product strategies. Bypassing the process of handcrafting the user interfaces by copying creates no competitive edge for the China "copycats", simply because everyone else is copying and there is a bigger fight after the product release.

## Copying vs. Forking

Similar to copying, there is another term in the [git](http://git-scm.org)-powered open source community called "forking". As defined on [Wikepedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)),

> In software engineering, a project fork happens when developers take a copy of source code from one software package and start independent development on it, creating a distinct piece of software.

The key difference is "independent development" after the forking. Taking another look at the more successful products which were originally copied, one can easily identify the path after its initial release could be drastically different than its "master branch". When Tencent's flagship IM product QQ was still named as OICQ, it faced the competition of 10+ other ICQ copycats. Forced to rename to QQ, the most popular IM software globally has evolved through so many iterations with additions of original innovations. This is a perfect example of forking.

However, it is always easier to criticize a new product for its similarity to another. Alan Zhang, the creator of Tencent WeChat, recently defended for the new Path-like features of WeChat 4.0 that critics only notice the similarity of certain features but overlooked the long-term strategic potentials. Forking, when first happened, was not different than copying except its intention of independent development in the long run. This is how you read the famous Steve Jobs quote:

> The good artists copy; the great artists steal.
