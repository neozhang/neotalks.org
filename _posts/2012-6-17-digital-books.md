Digital book reading on mobile devices is incredibly popular in China. Without gadgets like Kindle or Nook, China users have developed a skill of using whatever phones (imagine the MTK and Symbian phones) they have to read books, anytime and anywhere (on the bus, in the toilet or in bed). When it comes to iPhone and Android, the Books category continues to dominate the chart of average usage time. However, the demographics has shifted: the smartphone users can afford the books better and want better quality of the contents.

The online reading giant Shanda Literature has set the rule for this business very early one. It proves that the working business model for online reading is to provide entertaining fictional contents, the beginning of which free, and the rest paid. The writers under Shanda Literature have developed a special skill to update their contents every day and always attract the readers to follow up on the day after. Each “book” can be as long as a millions of characters, taking years to finish. Shanda was also successful in terms of using corporate investment power to consolidate the industry quickly enough in order to create the monopoly of content rights, including all forms of the same contents (digital books, paper books, TV and movies).

## The New World of Digital Books
Shanda Literature is lucrative business (IPO filed last year but delayed, current valuation USD 800MM). But in my mind it’s more of an entertainment business – similar to what Shanda is first known as an online gaming company. When I was looking for the books worth reading and digesting, choices would immedidately shrink. The disruptive solutions are in development, and we watch them very closely with the best heart.

### Tangcha
[Tangcha](http://www.tangcha.cc/) published its first book “Out of Control” by [Kevin Kelly](http://kk.org/) on iPhone and iPad as an individual app almost a year ago. Until recently after several one-book-in-one-app titles (including the famous Steve Jobs bio) were published, it released the “Byte Press” app, which enables user to purchase and organize their books in this one app.

Lawrence Li, the founder of Tangcha, is an experienced editor with an artist heart. He picks up the product design details like the fonts used and how footnotes should be displayed, as well as what books should be published in what way. Many would agree that Tangcha has the position of taste-making in the market, which identifies itself from the other competitors well enough.

Below comes the [Top In-app Purchases](http://www.appannie.com/app/ios/zi-jie-she/) chart for Byte Press. The top hit is the Chinese version of “What Technology Wants” by Kevin Kelly, priced at $1.99 (or half of the price of a Tall Latte at Starbucks in China). The other popular titles include some Chinese classics as well as popular fictions.

Tangcha’s initial apps were released under the name of CITIC Press, a leading publishing house in China, indicating the connections between the start-up and the traditional book publishers.

### Duokan
[Duokan](http://duokan.com) started by making custom builds of Kindle software. When the gadget geeks in China bought their Kindles, they realized that the built-in Chinese language support can be well improved by using Duokan’s hacks. Soon Duokan becomes the go-to place for most of the Chinese Kindle users – a community was built for users to exchange ebook resources. Duokan created Android and iOS apps for its users to expand the reach – more importantly to capitalize the user base.

Duokan’s launch title on iOS was “Hacker and Painter” by [Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com]. The book was very popular when it was first introduced in Chinese last year. It seems that Duokan wants to break into the higher-end readership by leveaging its geeky user base from the Kindle community. But going down the [top chart of its IAP](http://www.appannie.com/app/ios/duo-kan-yue-du/), other titles were mainstream enough to include the popular titles.

Duokan raised USD 10MM in total. Its angel investors include Lei Jun, a tech veteran in China now making Xiaomi Phones.

### Douban
[Douban](http://read.douban.com)‘s approach into digital reading is different from the others. It focuses on the contents which are not available in traditional publishing channels by directly signing authors and publishing on its own platforms (including web, mobile and Kindle). Most of books released to date are short stories or collections of essays, priced at RMB 1 – 2.

Douban has the most powerful and relevant distrubition platform for these contents through its unique community of books, music and movies. Direct relationship with authors could create conflict with traditional publishers, as we have seen on Amazon in US. That could be the reason why Douban has been so careful with the type of contents to publish.

### The Economics: Pricing and Distribution
Are you willing to pay a discounted price for the same content but delivered digitally? How much would the discount would be? This has been an question to everyone in the digital book business.

Apple and Amazon have different answers in favor of different interests. In China, it’s even more in a case-by-case scenerio. Duokan [disclosed](http://www.ifanr.com/65468) that it shares 70% of the sales revenue to the book publishers. Tangcha had the case of paying a fix amount of “copyright fees” to the pubisher. The price per book on these two platforms are roughly USD 1 or 2, incredibly cheap comparing to Kindle or iBooks, also cheap enough comparing to the paper books in China (less than 50% of the retail price of the same book). Only making this worse, they also have to pay 30% revenue to Apple first on iOS.

Thin-margin business only works with a large user base. To attract more readers, platforms have to radically diversify their catalog of books. Fragmentation and competition will drive up the cost of copyrights. Industry consolidation will be inevitable.

The Douban approach is interestingly different. It has a promising distribution power for authors to capture the long tail readership. The more affordable pricing strategy will help establish the initial user base. I believe Douban will expand the platform into the longer-formed reading market – it never limited itself to be a platform for short stories, which I see as merely an introductory mode.
