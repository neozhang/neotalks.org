Being local no longer simply means having Google Map and Foursquare API integrated. It also means digging into deeper levels to map out the fundamental elements of life - food ordering is one good example, how about finding the best laundry service nearby? With the these new “maps”, consumers are enjoying more convenience in their local life.

[Meican](http://meican.com) is a location-based service which helps people to order food from nearby restaurants. Instead of building the delivery force on its own, the start-up simply partnered with the restaurants who have already accepted the phone orders and aggregated the menus into its mobile app. With a few simple taps and without any hassles of making phone calls, the food will be delivered as desired. More interestingly, the mobile app has a timer counting since the order was placed, and every operational process is updated on the same UI, so the user will not feel like being left alone. If looking deeper, one will find that the service also offered every signed restaurant a toll-free phone number for the customers who wish to talk instead of tap. Once the food is delivered, the app asks the user to log the completion of the order.

Since its launch last July, Meican covers 4 major cities in China, but the coverage of restaurants is deep enough to include Shaxian Xiaochi, a local fast food chain with average order value of 2 US dollars. Its product and business model seems similar to the Chicago-based startup [Grubhub.com](http://grubhub.com), which has been around for almost 5 years. Both services charge commissions from restaurants for each order delivered, which sounds quite reasonable as a value proposition.

[eDaijia.cn](http://edaijia.cn) is another good example of capitalizing on the increasing usage of automobile. Similar to [Über](http://uber.com), users can use its mobile app to easily find an experienced driver nearby who can drive him / her back home. Different than the use case in US, eDaijia is very popular among those who like to grab drinks at clubs or bars. To improve the response time of the drivers, the service had to offer cheap smartphones to drivers - the cost could be somewhere around USD 100. For each ride, the service charges the driver certain percentage of revenue.

Yuancheng Yang, the co-founder of [Jiepang](http://jiepang.com) (the most successful app in China following classic Foursquare model), compared this development to what happened to search engines. “There are many vertical search engines, e.g. travel and real estate, but people still use services like Baidu as a gateway to online information.”

Like search engines for the online information, LBS or O2O services are our new “maps” to the offline world. The classic definition of a map is to find directions to somewhere to go. With more data layers on top, the new “maps” are designed to figure out where to go, “unlocking surprises” like in Foursquare, or even solutions to problems without going anywhere. The opportunities sit in mapping out the hyperlocal connections around our everyday life. Obviously, more services are helping us unlock these surprises, though not necessarily on Foursquare.
