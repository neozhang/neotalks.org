[Big Spaceship](http://bigspaceship.com) is a digital creative agency based in New York City. They work with some of the largest brands to help creative digital assets on the web. 

On the side, they also have a blogs where they write about web front-end, design and interesting apps. The [Forward Thinking](http://www.bigspaceship.com/category/our-thinking/forwardthinking/) is a weekly series sharing "what's inspiring" them. They have also worked with tech leaders like Adobe to create [The Expressive Web](http://beta.theexpressiveweb.com/).

This is how media and technology should work together. Very few firms (both media and tech) in China have developed such interests in working outside of their home zones - it usually requires bold attempts to bring together engineering power and creative minds - let go the ROI calc for a moment, and just try out new things no matter if it attracts new customers or create extra mindshare (it does).
