There are two content models available in general:

- The content funded by advertisement, and
- The content paid by its audience.

My full-time job is all about connecting the people willing to pay for the ads with the content creators / publishers, so people can easily afford the entertainment or enlightenment delivered in forms of texts, images, video or other interactive media. It is the massive I/O capturing people's attention, and disturb them with "relevant" advertisement.

My personal life, a.k.a. the weekend, is usually spent on a totally different type of content. I watch movies by purchasing tickets, read books by paying at the bookstore, or play games by paying on the App Store. I usually feel that I am better served if I am consuming the paid version of the content.

What is the difference between the paid and free versions? The answer comes from how free content could support itself: advertisement. Advertising technologies can easily feed a continuous stream of promotional information into any types of content. However, that is exactly where the problem is: people are disturbed.

When I am sitting in front of a movie, nothing gets between this scene and the next one. If someone wants to pee, he would be apologizing for disturbing the other audience. The same applies to paid books and paid apps. When I am reading on Kindle or Instapaper, I enjoy the undisturbed experience where nothing is pushed to my attention and I can control my own rhythm of reading. It is very similar to the willingness to pay for the service charge at a high-class restaurant for quality service and undisturbed privacy.

Going back to my work, I can easily name five techniques to feed ”relevant” ads to content. Sadly these techniques are merely types of disturbance: the more relevant ads accompanied with the actual content, the more disturbed audience would be. If one tracks his browsing history, he could easily get lost in the chaotic routes, intercepted by sponsored hyperlinks, images, animations and videos, navigating to unexpectable destinations.  

The ad-funded model has nothing wrong. Actually most magazines and newspapers are funded by advertisement for decades. This is how the media business works, short-cycled and ad-funded content types (TV, newspaper or magazines) support themselves by advertising for the long-cycled and audience-funded content types (movies or books). This completes the happy eco-system of content production and publishing. However, most consumers tend to appreciate the lower acquisition cost of ad-funded content in exchange to the undisturbed experience. Only using the example of iOS apps, we can see a decreasing average selling price in the past quarters. Behind the increasing competition, app publishers were pushed to lower their selling price until they use the "free with ads" or "freemium" model.

What truly disturbs me is this "competition". It pushes the balance between the two content types towards a situation where the ad-funded model could win a little more easily. Sometimes I prefer using the Native Apps to the Web Apps, simply because the world hasn't found a distracting enough ad format on the former whereas the later have been too much ad-dominated.
