title: Superstar & Gold Rush
category: en

I met with one of most famous tech bloggers in China, [Li Nan](http://twitter.com/newkonsou), this afternoon. He writes for [ifanr.com](http://ifanr.com) on various topics including mobile, social and apps. It was very interesting to hear his perspectives on how the idea of “developer eco-system” can get traction from a media standpoint.

He compared the project I am working to the ones who sell jeans to the gold-rushers. To sell more jeans, you need to convince people that there is a big goldmine. The most convincing story is not that thousands of people have earned some average amounts, but one individual who made a billion. That single superstar will inspire thousands of people to rush for the gold, which might not even exist, and buy your jeans.

Interestingly, this relates to the Behavioral Finance course I took in college. Risk-takers are more willing to take the bet to win a large amount at a small chance, rather than take an outcome with certainty. Gold-rushers are definitely risk-takers. But how about mobile app developers? I asked the question [here](http://www.zhihu.com/question/19628574?isn=1). Feel free to answer it there or leave a comment below (note: comments closed).
