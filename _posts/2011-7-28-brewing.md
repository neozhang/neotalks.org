I like the word “brew”. It usually takes extra care, patience and thoughts to make sure things are aligned precisely correct.

It is like what we are working on right now - an idea-level refresh on the product. Everyone now starts to rethink about their design, code, documentation and process. We discuss several times everyday to keep each of us in the golden state of sync. Sometimes I am really amazed by our self-disruption, but I can always find a strong position to feel peaceful when I see how we actually navigate through, of course, with the extra care, patience and thoughts, required in the process of brewing something great.

“Brewing” is an art rather than a science. It is all about balancing this and that, with the consideration of timing and other subtle factors. Automated procedures will not solve the problem at all, neither do recipes ever exist. Trial and error in years only take you to an intermediate level. Only inspirational friends and teams can help form ideas and plans. They are the key ingredients or the secret sauce behind the scene.

I cannot wait to see the thing up on the stage. It is the time to think about its debut - it has to be really special (in a good way) to respond to the hard-brewing we are going through right now.
