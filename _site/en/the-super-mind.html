			<p>Recently, Steven Levy of Wired <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/04/can-an-algorithm-write-a-better-news-story-than-a-human-reporter/">wrote</a> about the technology that would change the journalism world drastically. A company called Narrative Science has decoded the science of composing news for sports games and management reporting.</p>

<p>It was a long piece. But the length didn't prevent me from reading it through in the middle of a nice dinner with friends. This technology really matters, as it replaced something that was considered as irreplaceable: the arts and craftsmanship of news.</p>

<p>I had my doubts: it doesn't really matter if this technique can only be applied in sports or financial reporting, as both were nothing more than dry data. You could instead read the scores or charts, which could be automatically populated by computers easily already. However, we can all imagine how break-throughs on small areas like this will later on be amplified and spread all over.</p>

<p>I broadcasted it on Weibo to bring attention to my journalist friends. People like me, who always care about the arts of writing and editing, would definitely be shocked by such a fast-approaching reality, more than how we were worried about the robots which do the heavy-lifting work.</p>

<p>Writers are not alone. Text-mining algorithms are also in the fast-forwarding mode. The <a href="http://www.summly.com/">Summly</a> app, developed by a twenty-something in Hong Kong, can summarize any long form of reading into a few bullet points, replacing the junior analysts' job. Get it on the App Store, for free, today.</p>

<p>More obviously:</p>

<ul>
<li>Google Translate, which takes user corrections into its huge machine learning engine and improves its translation quality, supposed to kill all the professional translation firms in a few years;</li>
<li>Apple Siri, acting as a fast-learning personal assistant, listening to every single piece of your wants and complaints: the intimacy will transform into something terribly huge.</li>
<li>Amazon, growing its shopping catalog from books to gadgets to digital media and recently to an unlimited variety of possibilities provided by 3rd-party merchants, possible to serve your next orders before you realize what those are;</li>
<li>Facebook Likes, in the form of emotional sprints everywhere on the Web, taking hundreds of millions of inputs every day, in order to display ads for your "meh" brands.</li>
</ul>


<p>...</p>

<p>There are a few different types of Internet ideologies:</p>

<ol>
<li>Build connections between people so the sum of the connected brains can think together, e.g. Social Networks,</li>
<li>Build learning cortexes so the computers can improve their intelligence over time e.g. Search Engines.</li>
</ol>


<p>The two paths usually intersect: Facebook would want to data mine its user data to raise its click-through rate of ads, and Google would like to see information flow between people so it could exploit the value under the social relationship. It is the convergence of the two that makes me sick: the Super Mind, driven by tireless machines and adaptive algorithms, who understands the nature of human relations, emotions and cultures.</p>

<p>If what Kevin Kelly alleged is right, the evolution of <a href="http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/">Technium</a> is rapidly alter the balance of our life, not only Human vs. Nature, but also Human vs. Tech.</p>

<p>Till this far, what the Super Mind has done is merely the pushing us ads we seem to like, friends we might know, or guessing what else we would purchase next. Few is thinking: how much of this can be replicated on other more important decisions, such like birth  marriage or death. Is a calculated life something we want to choose? Or is it something which we still have a choice for in the end?</p>
