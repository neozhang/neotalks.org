			<p>I don’t have many sleepless nights, especially the desperate ones. Sometimes when I cannot sleep, it is usually because I am excited about things in life - thinking of the rush of blood to your head - beds are just too small to hold your entire universe.</p>

<p>When I was still in middle school, I was convinced that sleep is not a physical need. Being a late-nighter or early-riser, I work at my little desk teasing my brain, believing the extra awake hours can boost my life. Until recently, I read about the article on WSJ about how a small percent of the mankind does not need that much sleep to function well. It sounds like a late proof to what I believed since school years.</p>

<p>I am having sleep problems recently, waking up several times every night. Kind friends asked me why I checked in so many times at home in early morning time. These check-ins are not fake. They only mean that I am awake and bored. Most of the time I could turn back to sleep in 5 or 10 minutes. Today I failed and decided to get up.</p>

<p>Mornings are really pleasant. It is super quiet and the Internet is amazingly fast (this is where it is supposed to be). I opened my window to let fresh air in and also enjoyed the chirping birds. The sound of the Nature is so familiar - when did I say that I want to record it (hint: a few days ago in Shanghai). This is the time to deeply dive into your own world. Just stay away from all the disturbance and live your own life.</p>
