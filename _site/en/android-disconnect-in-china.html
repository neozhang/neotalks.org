			<p>As you may understand, in China - where most of the Google services are disconnected, the Android ecosystem is not merely a mirror of its global situation.</p>

<p>With its market share approaching 70% by end of 2011 in China, (source), Android has penetrated the mainstream phone user group to be the new "street phone" of choice by many. Not only the device-makers and carriers are behind this push, many Internet companies, e.g. Baidu, 360 and Shanda, are also going after this trend closely. Priced aggressively between RMB 1,000 - 2,000 (USD150 - 300), these phones are equipped with top-notch hardware specs as well as the ambitions to unite the device and service ecosystem on their owns.</p>

<p>Eventually they have nothing to do with Google.</p>

<h2>Battle among Internet giants</h2>

<p>Going back to 2011 when carriers successfully teamed up with the local phone OEMs (Huawei, ZTE, Lenovo, etc.) to push Android phones around RMB 1,000 (USD 150) to millions of consumers, Xiaomi, with its deep root in China's Internet industry, has published its first-gen phones with a beautifully revamped user interface on top of the home-brew Android OS on its own online and China Unicom distribution channels. Xiaomi phone was carefully designed, built, priced at RMB 1,999 (USD 300, without a carrier contract) and sold exclusively on its website at the very beginning. The company executed its marketing plans on social media and its fan community (BBS) almost perfectly, until the recent "quality crisis" brought up by Zhou Hongyi, the founder and CEO of Qihoo 360.</p>

<p>Qihoo 360, the desktop software giant, has captured 80%+ of PCs in China, by providing security and other utility software and acting as the gateway to the consumer PC experience on top of the desktop OS. The company recently announced its plans to work with device makers to release Android devices, and soon involved itself with Xiaomi's "quality crisis" on Weibo. Most of Internet veterans in China know the respective founders of two companies - Qihoo's Zhou Hongyi and Xiaomi's Lei Jun, regard each other as irreconcilable enemies. However, a bigger picture is that many other Internet companies want to have its own branded Android phones on the market.</p>

<h2>Following Amazon?</h2>

<p>Many would compare this to what Amazon has done by releasing the ultra-cheap Android tablet Kindle Fire. Many sources indicated that Amazon could be losing money on each unit sold. But the low price successfully pushed sales and market share until very recently. Questions have been flowing around the tech community about how the money-losing-on-each-unit-sold Kindle Fire would pay back its initial investment. Could it be content sales, membership fees or advertising, Amazon is luckily a company which sells tangible products and services. Can this be the case for the Chinese phone-making web companies?</p>

<p>In a recent post of ifanr (one of the most popular Chinese tech blog), an author joked about how the blog would release its own branded phone, with a tweaked Android build and preloaded applications. I liked the sense of humor in that article, which received more than 100 comments with a few hours. When the web portal, social networking and online gaming giants are thinking about the mobile opportunities, they realized that gatekeeping is more important than any single app. While rushing to clone Instagram or Path, they also urged their product strategists to contact design houses and OEMs to calculate the BOM (bill of material) cost. On a large scale assumption, the upfront cash outlay will spread on each device user, and ultimately capitalize on the advertising, virtual currency as well as e-commerce profits, within the device lifecycle.</p>

<p>Another potential item to factor in is the carrier partnership. To quickly shift to the more lucrative data business, all three major telecom carriers in China are compensating phone purchases to attract consumers to sign up two-year contracts. Android cannot be more suitable to this vision - cheap and highly customizable (potential for ad-funded models). Most Internet companies have had happy partnerships with carriers (under the Service Provider model where they share the revenue from selling SMS and MMS plans). This party again has a bright future for everyone.</p>

<p>Kaifu Lee, the founder and CEO of Innovation Works, was not positive about this question. The dilemma of maintaining a high-quality phone experience against factory-installing apps on the phone can never be easy for most of these web companies. Everyone plays a defensive tactic to not lose in the "Star War" of building phones to distribute apps. The loss of not attending the party could be strategically painful in the long term, whereas the gain from the investment may not be guaranteed by the preloaded applications.</p>

<h2>Neutrality and Connectivity</h2>

<p>Sometimes the closed nature of iOS and Windows Phone looks more promising to me. The openness of Android offers too much for the device-makers sometimes. While adding Internet players to the picture, we see too many better or worse executed UI tweaks, each coming with a favor towards a few disconnected pieces of the overall Android ecosystem. Begun with tens of Android Market clones, the Android world becomes even more disconnected now: apps on the Baidu phones (ironically that Baidu is using Android in China) will carry Baidu apps, which do not connect with the apps on the Shanda phones. When Samsung released its Kik-like messaging app, I was already thinking how this trend will continue. Apparently, we will see this more in the upcoming future. A unified communication experience on Android phones will be even harder to find when “phone app” makers are trying to lock their users within their proprietary networks. When the disconnected experience ultimately breaks the network effect, users will challenge the model of bundling phone and apps. Hardware sales number will get hurt, investment put at risk.</p>

<p>That's why I think these Internet companies are merely to buying installs for their apps. The openness of Android allows them to make the press release prettier. Unfortunately, it adds to the disconnect in Android ecosystem, planting inherent problems in the long-term roadmaps of their closed systems (think how recent they have opened their APIs). Phones are made as communication tools. The neutrality and connectivity are too valuable to ignore when you talk about making phones.</p>
